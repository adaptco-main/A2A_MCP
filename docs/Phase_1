# Phase 1: Persistence Layer Initialization
Goal: Transition from stateless execution to a durable SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL back-end.

## Core Setup
- Establish `schemas/database.py` for ArtifactModel persistence.
- Define `schemas/agent_artifacts.py` as the Pydantic contract for A2A communication[cite: 32].
- Status: Established core dependencies in `requirements.txt`[cite: 232].
