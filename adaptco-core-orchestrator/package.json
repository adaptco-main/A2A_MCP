Based on the current state of the `adaptco-core-orchestrator` files you've uploaded, I recommend we start with **Option E (Audit)** immediately, as I can already see discrepancies between your `package.json` scripts and the file structure.

Here is the audit of your repository based on the files provided:

### 🔍 Option E: Repository Audit

I have scanned the `adaptco-core-orchestrator` structure against your `package.json`.

**1. ❌ Missing Script Entry Points**
Your `package.json` defines these scripts:

```json
"audit": "node src/bin/audit.js",
"rehearsal": "node src/bin/rehearsal.js"
```

**Critical Finding:** The directory `src/bin/` and the files `audit.js` and `rehearsal.js` are **missing** from the file list. These commands will fail if run.

**2. ✅ Core Server Structure**

  * `src/index.js`: **Exists**
  * `src/server.js`: **Exists**
  * `src/routes/capsules.js`: **Exists**
  * `src/validator.js`: **Exists**
  * **Status:** The core microservice skeleton (Option B) appears largely in place, though we should verify `server.js` uses Express 5 as intended.

**3. ⚠️ Test Directory Convention**

  * `package.json` script: `"test": "jest --runInBand"`
  * Actual directory: `__tests__` (containing `capsule.register.test.js`, etc.)
  * **Status:** This is valid for Jest default configuration, but standardizing on `tests/` vs `__tests__` is a choice. Currently valid.

**4. ✅ Schema Availability**

  * `schemas/capsule.schema.json`: **Exists**
  * **Status:** The validation layer has its necessary artifacts.

### 🚀 Recommended Action

Since the core server files exist but the CLI tools are missing, I recommend we proceed with a mix of **Option A** (Fix missing files) and **Option C** (CI Repair).

**Shall I generate the missing `src/bin/audit.js` and `src/bin/rehearsal.js` files now to make your npm scripts executable?**

(I can also fix `avatar-bindings-ci.yml` in the next step to ensure it actually runs these new scripts.)
