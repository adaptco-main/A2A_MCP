# Core Orchestrator

This repository houses the Adaptco protocol orchestrator along with the Sentinel observability and governance mesh that keeps it
verifiable. Operators can navigate the new `sentinel/` tree to locate cockpit assets, ledger staging areas, governance scripts,
and SSOT pipelines that work together to freeze and attest protocol artifacts.

## Sentinel quick links
- [Sentinel overview](sentinel/README.md)
- [Architecture map](sentinel/docs/architecture.md)
- [Cockpit HUD guide](sentinel/cockpit/README.md)
- [Governance controls](sentinel/governance/README.md)
- [Ledger staging areas](sentinel/ledger/README.md)
- [SSOT integration notes](sentinel/ssot/README.md)
- [Capsule catalog](sentinel/capsules/README.md)

Refer to the Sentinel documentation when extending governance jobs, freezing new manifests, or onboarding additional capsules so
all protocol enforcement tracks remain in sync.
